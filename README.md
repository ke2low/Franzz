## Work Distribution

### :metal: Kalvin (ke2low)

I was responsible for the overall design and styling of the application including ensuring that the application would be responsive. I also designed and built the majority of the front-end UI components. In addition, I was involved in implenting the functionality to pass data between the front-end and back-end, so that UI components could be dynamically generated and also so that the components could take in user data. I also contributed to building out the collaborative drawing and geolocation application widgets. Lastly, I utilized FontAwesome, Google Fonts and MaterialUI components to add to the overall design aesthetic of the application.

### :muscle: Julie (juliebede)

My focus for Franz was working with the Youtube Syncing feature (back-end to front-end), this includes connecting clients using SocketIO as well as using the Youtube API. I had also created the photo gallery feature (back-end to front-end), using the Cloudinary API. In specific, I built the platform to integrate media data transfer into the chat textbox, input to be used between our client and server with the cloudinary API. I also assisted in the overall UI design and style of the application in addition to helping clean up inconsistencies that may occured.

### :sweat_drops: Eric (melonfruity)

I focused on building the general structure of the application and managing the project as I had the overall view of everyones work. I designed the file management system for both client and server side as well as the data hierarchy, flow and file structure for the React client. This was done along-side the applications authentification, core chat functionality, the maps and canvas plugins and building the React Native app. Finally, I supported my group members by helping fix bugs and giving suggestions to their focuses if they needed it.
